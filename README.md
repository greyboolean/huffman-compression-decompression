# huffman-compression-decompression
Java program for file compression and decompression using Huffman coding

This is a Java program that enables file compression and decompression using the Huffman coding algorithm. It takes a text file as input and outputs three files: (1) a file containing characters and their frequencies, (2) an encoded file, and (3) a decoded file.

## Features

- File Compression: Reduce the size of text files using Huffman coding, preserving their original content.
- File Decompression: Restore compressed files to their original form.

## How to Use

1. Set the file paths in the `main` method of the program correctly, specifying the input text file and desired output file paths.
2. Compile and run the program.
3. The program will generate the three output files: the character frequency file, the encoded file, and the decoded file.
